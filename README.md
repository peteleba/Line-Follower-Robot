# Line-Follower-Robot
This Line Follower Robot is a fundamental robotics project, using two infrared (IR) sensors and an Arduino to autonomously follow a black line on a white surface. The robot adjusts its direction based on sensor input, making real-time decisions to stay on course.

Components:

Arduino Microcontroller
Motor Driver Module
2 Gear Motors and Wheels
Chassis
2 IR Sensors (for line detection)
Battery Pack (LiPo batteries)
Breadboard and Jumper Wires
Features:

Real-time line detection using IR sensors
Autonomous movement control with gear motors
Simple yet effective control logic programmed on Arduino
Assembly:

Mount Motors: Attach the motors and wheels to the chassis.
Wiring: Connect IR sensors and motor driver to Arduino using jumper wires and a breadboard.
Power Supply: Attach the battery pack to power the system.
Upload Code: Use the Arduino IDE to upload the code in this repository.
